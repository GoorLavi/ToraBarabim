// `dir="auto"` resolves direction from the value's first strong directional
// character. A value without one, whether empty or only whitespace, falls
// back to `ltr` in Chrome, which puts a Hebrew placeholder and the caret on
// the wrong side of a field the user reads as blank. Forcing `rtl` until
// there is real content, then handing back to `auto`, keeps a genuinely
// Latin value (a Latin place name) rendering LTR.
export const directionForValue = (value: string): 'rtl' | 'auto' => (value.trim() ? 'auto' : 'rtl');
