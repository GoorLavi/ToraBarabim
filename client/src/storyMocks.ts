// Shared support for every Storybook story that answers this app's own
// fetch calls: Storybook's preview server has no live API behind it (unlike
// the app itself, which vite.config.ts proxies to the real API in dev), so
// every route a story's page calls has to be answered here instead.
//
// `installMockFetch` chains onto whatever `window.fetch` already is, so
// several story files can each install a mock in any load order without
// clobbering each other: a handler that does not recognise a URL returns
// `null` and falls through to whatever was there before. Its return value
// restores the previous `fetch`, for a caller (`LoginPage.stories.tsx`) that
// needs to undo the mock between stories via a `beforeEach` hook; a caller
// that installs one mock for the whole file, as most do, can simply ignore
// the return value.
//
// `respond` also receives the request method, uppercased, defaulting to
// 'GET': a handler that only checks the URL cannot tell a list GET from a
// same-path POST or PATCH apart, so a mutation would silently match a list
// handler and read as an always-succeeding write. Existing callers that
// only destructure `url` keep working unchanged: a function of fewer
// parameters is assignable wherever more are expected.
